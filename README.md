# Overview

MagicHeim is a mod that adds classes and magic in Valheim. I am the dev of previous big magic mod: MagicOverhaul, and MagicHeim is basically MO v2.0 . Renewed with new systems / features, quality instead of quantity and other major changes.

In current plans each class have 25 active skills and 10 passives. I wanted to release this mod only when class amount will be at least 3, but im afraid that amount of bugs will be too much, so i decided to release it earlier. I will add more classes in future updates.

Close future plans; Finish Warrior + Druid classes. Add Class weapons + add "boss" skills for each of these classes.

Further plans: Add more classes (Assassin, Warlock?), add more skills, add more features.

What is working currently:

* Classes System (you can take Mage only at this moment since other classes are not finished)
* Class Skills
* Level System (you can get level by killing enemies or "eating" books)
* Skill Points (you can get skill points by leveling up)
* Skill Learn / Upgrade
* Every skill has tones of config options which are already serversynced
* Other configs not related to skills
* Skills are tested in multiplayer and seem to work with no problems

Im **SURE** that it will be a lot of bugs so please feel free to report all of them to me (discord link below). Also feel free to suggest your ideas. Mod is currently in active development so its not too late to change anything you want.

In order to take your first class you need to place a MagicHeim Altar. To do so you would need to use any admin / cheat tool to enable Debug Mode. Its done on purpose so that on servers only admins could place Altar on map.
